I'm currently a researcher at Inria (chargée de recherche), where I'm based in the [Quriosity team](https://iqa.telecom-paris.fr/) at Télécom Paris. Previously, I completed my PhD under the supervision of [Roger Colbeck](https://www.york.ac.uk/maths/staff/roger-colbeck/) and then went on to work in the [Navascués group](https://www.iqoqi-vienna.at/research/navascues-group/) at the Institute for Quantum Optics and Quantum Information (IQOQI) Vienna and in the [Quantum Theory group](https://www.unige.ch/gap/qic/theory/news) at the University of Geneva.

## Research Interests

I am broadly interested in problems within *quantum information* and the *foundations of quantum theory*. I am particularly interested in understanding the physical principles that underlie quantum theory as well as in the dectection of quantum resources and communication in quantum networks. I like to work with tools from convex and polynomial optimisation theory.
